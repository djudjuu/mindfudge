...on a small dapp-game for 2 players to play over ethereum blockchain 

 ##  Rules
 Every Player gets cards from 1-5.
 Each round, both players put a card in the middle. 
 The player with the higher card wins the round.
 First player to win 3 rounds wins the game
 its possible to bet ether and to set time limits to submitting them
 and maximum game length

(work in progress... later versions should implement playing cards
needs to be done in a 2stepfashion, first hash, then revealmessage)
